CALCULATOR APP :
HTML:

The calculator layout is created using an input field for the display and buttons for numbers and operations.
Buttons are organized in a grid layout for easy interaction.

CSS:
The calculator is styled with a clean and modern look, centered on the page.
Buttons have hover and active states to give feedback when clicked.

JavaScript:
The clearDisplay function clears the input field.
The deleteLast function removes the last character from the input field.
The appendToDisplay function adds the clicked button's value to the display.
The calculate function evaluates the expression in the display using the eval function and shows the result.

Customization :
Design: Modify the CSS to change the color scheme, button size, or overall layout.
Functionality: Add more features, like handling more complex operations, using parentheses, or allowing keyboard input.
This project gives a good starting point for building and understanding the basics of web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

IMAGE GALLERY :
HTML: 
The gallery is set up using div elements for each image. When a user clicks on an image, the modal opens and displays the full-size image.

CSS: 
The gallery layout is styled to be responsive and visually appealing. The modal is styled to cover the entire screen with a dark overlay and includes navigation buttons.

JavaScript: 
The script controls the opening and closing of the modal, as well as navigation between images within the modal.
Customization
Images: Replace image1.jpg, image2.jpg, etc., with your actual image paths.
Styling: Adjust the CSS for different layouts or visual effects.
Features: Extend the JavaScript to add features like automatic slideshow, thumbnails, or captions for each image.

MUSIC PLAYER 
HTML (index.html):
Defines the structure of the music player, including buttons and audio elements.

CSS (styles.css): 
Adds styling to the HTML elements, making the music player look visually appealing.

JavaScript (scripts.js):
Adds interactivity by enabling play, pause, and stop functionalities for the music player, as well as displaying song information.

Instructions to Run:

Create Files:
Create a file named index.html and paste the HTML code into it.
Create a file named styles.css and paste the CSS code into it.
Create a file named scripts.js and paste the JavaScript code into it.

Add an Audio File:
Ensure you have a file named song.mp3 in the same directory as your HTML file, or update the src attribute in the <audio> tag to match your audio file's name.

Run the Music Player:
Open the index.html file in your web browser to see your music player in action.
This structure effectively divides your project into three buckets: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
